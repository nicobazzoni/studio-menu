      desc: `Go to cue 40 on GIO, Make sure hoists are gridded. Check with stage manager if there are to be any guests and if so determine if they'll be upstairs or downstairs for the segment. Any downstairs interviews will be conducted at " Faulkner Stools Position" with hoists and chandelier at outnumbered position. Find the magic sheet titled "Interview" to make appropriate adjustments. Make sure appropriate ND and/or scrim has been brought to contest any overexposure from sunlight. Communicate with Camera person and Stage Manager to determine if elevators are needed for camera location movement. Make sure south scrims are adequately blocking sunlight which is extreme at that time in mid afternoon. Frequently the operator on Faulkner Focus will also work Outnumbered which comes directly after Focus. This makes it necessary to pre-pro for outnumbered as well. Pre-pro for outnumbered includes making sure all units are operational, the hoists and chandelier are responsive to "outnumbered" positions, windows are un-fogged, batteries for floor table unit LED's are charged and the units themselves turned on so they'll be ready once you go to Outumbered Cue.`,
